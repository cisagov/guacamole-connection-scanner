This project is a Python utility that continually scans the EC2 instances
in an AWS VPC and adds/removes Guacamole connections in the underlying
PostgreSQL database accordingly.

This utility is [Dockerized](https://docker.com) in
[cisagov/guacscanner-docker](https://github.com/cisagov/guacscanner-docker),
and the resulting Docker container is intended to run as a part of
[cisagov/guacamole-composition](https://github.com/cisagov/guacamole-composition),
although it could - probably uselessly - run in a [Docker
composition](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) alongside only the
[official PostgreSQL Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).
